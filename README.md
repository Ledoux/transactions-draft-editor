# transactions-draft-editor
A text editor from react draft js with already classic inline style toolbar, mathjax and drag and drop plugins

For now quick setup:
onVisibilityChanged = (visibleBlock) => {
setTimeout (() => {
   if (!_this._reactInternalInstance) {
       return
   }
   let position
   ...
